\begin{abstract}
This paper analyzes the quality and consistency of the data provided by three free financial data providers (\textit{AlphaVantage}, \textit{MarketStack}, \textit{StockData}) with the data provided by the \textit{SIX Id}. International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) has been selected as the reference stock due to its long trading history, beginning with its IPO on November 11, 1915 \cite{EvolutionOfIBMfromPunchCardsToQuantumComputers}, and also because of numerous corporate actions that may affect the historical price series. Differences across datasets are calculated by comparing daily adjusted and unadjusted opening and closing prices. The analysis revealed significant variations among adjusted prices, while unadjusted prices are found to be almost identical, with only minor differences attributable to numerical rounding.
